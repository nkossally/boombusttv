						<h2>Drive: A Defense of Hollywood Escapism
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						The least important element of Drive, and any movie in my opinion, is its plot. Fortunately, the plot is straightforward. Drive’s one sentence summary is a lonely unnamed getaway driver falls in love with his neighbor and her son, and when her husband returns from prison, Driver attempts to protect the family from gangsters to whom the husband owes protection money. Drive has simple characters with simple arcs or no arc. Driver, played by Ryan Gosling, is a laconic and morally ambiguous loner who falls in love with a family and consequently assumes the moral responsibility of killing the guys who threaten the family unit. Driver’s love interest is Irene, played by Carey Mulligan. Irene is nice. That’s about it. Carey Mulligan is a good enough actress to make something of the film’s wordless moments, but her character is just nice. And the bad guys are bad guys. Drive, like most Hollywood films, tells a simple story.
					</p>
					<p>
						The story Drive tells is not exciting. How it tells it is. The film builds tension by making smart decisions about showing and not showing. Rather than show a pawnshop robbery gone wrong, the camera shows Driver waiting in his car. Rather than show gangsters beat up Irene’s husband, the film shows the aftermath in which Driver comforts Irene’s traumatized son. In that scene, the boy’s small shadow and Driver’s substantially larger shadow prominently lay against the wall behind them. This matters in a film that engages in intentional and symbolic storytelling. Shadows reappear in the final scene when Driver’s shadow deals the killing blow to the primary antagonist of the film.
					</p>
					<p>
						Video essays on Drive have discussed the symbolism of the scorpion on Driver’s jacket,  the film’s use of color to represent characters,  and the film’s use of the quadrant system in order to frame scenes.  The film also uses visual storytelling to dichotomize good-girl Irene from fallen-woman Blanche, the latter of whom participates in a robbery alongside Driver. Irene is a slender blonde. Blanche is a voluptuous redhead. After Irene’s husband is killed, scenes of police interrogating Irene are crosscut with scenes of Driver interrogating Blanche. Blanche lies and looks towards the audience. Irene tells the truth from a sideview. Blanche is on the left side of the screen. Irene is on the right. Left, of course, symbolizes the bad and right symbolizes the good. Blanche suffers a horrible fate. Driver slaps her shortly before hitmen kill her. Irene manages to live. The good-girl-fallen-woman dichotomy is reductive and socially harmful. But it is a simple story that can be accomplished by effective visual storytelling. And despite the few lines Irene and Blanche have, the actresses who portray them make one-dimensional characters exciting to watch.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to clever camerawork and scene composition, Drive’s music tells the story of the film. The synthpop song “A Real Hero” plays twice during the runtime, asking in an on-the-nose and yet effective manner whether Driver can become a hero. The film uses the song to both bind and ultimately separate Driver and Irene. It plays first when Driver, Irene and her son spend an afternoon driving for pleasure and skipping rocks by a lake. “A real human being. And a real hero,” a female voice sings, approximating and melding with the sound of the synthetic instruments accompanying it. The electronic instruments and the human voice seem like variations of a single sound. The music and the noticeably golden tint of the scene melts one shot into the next, erasing how choppy the editing is. The first time “A Real Hero” plays, Driver is offered the hope of family life. The second time the song plays, near the end of the film, Driver finishes his hero’s journey by abandoning Irene. Driver has just killed the final monster. Golden sunlight frames Driver’s head as it rests against a headrest, and then the dream ends. The film cuts to Irene knocking on Driver’s door, to no response. Finally, the film cuts to Driver driving alone in the darkness. Tears well up in his eyes and do not fall. The escapist anthem of the film plays on as the screen fades to black.
					</p>
					<p>
						In an interview, Refn remarked that he used synthpop, the signature sound of the 80’s, to make the film seem timeless.   This is an easy and effective trick. If you mix the present with the past then the lessons back then are the same as the lessons now, which are the same lessons that have always been. Flattening time and dissolving context turns a story into a universal myth. Using both the trick of nostalgic music and the framework of a simple hero’s journey, Refn attempted to achieve timelessness and universality in Drive. I’m not sure Drive quite reaches mythic status, but it provides escape for nearly two hours.
					</p>
					<p>
					Refn is hardly alone in using synthpop to stir nostalgia. For sentimental and capitalist reasons, pop culture has been mining the 80’s for nostalgic material since, perhaps, the 1980’s. The decade witnessed a neoliberal anti-poor anti-black politics in the U.S. Popular 80’s movies such as Risky Business and Wall Street seem like pure expressions of capitalism in decay. And yet, synthpop triggers fond memories of the 80’s even among those who were not alive then. The politics and economics of the decade were awful for all except the very rich, but the aesthetics were fun and enduringly escapist.
					</p>
					<p>
						Exploring why I love Drive so much entails exploring why synthpop is probably my favorite genre of music. By a loose definition, synthpop is probably your favorite genre too since synthesizers are nearly universal in pop today. The history of synthpop and electronic music is longer than the history of the commodification of electronic music. Over the course of the twentieth century, engineers and artists refined technologies and techniques for reproducing the sound of classical instruments. 1968’s Switched-On Bach was an early forerunner of synthpop. The album was both cutting edge and nostalgic, using new technology to replicate well-known classics. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The device pop music listeners knowingly or unknowingly associate with synthpop is 1983’s Yamaha DX7, an instrument used by Whitney Houston, Brian Eno, Herbie Hancock and many more.  In the 80’s, synthesizers sounded like synthesizers, and not quite like classical instruments. By the 90’s, programable synthesizers more or less perfectly reproduced classical instruments. By then, however, grunge and indie rock displaced synthpop as the dominant form of pop. Synthpop experienced a revival in the early 2000’s only when artists began to use new technology to reproduce the sounds of 80’s synthesizers.  The point of the synthesizer transitioned from replicating classical instruments to replicating a replica.
					</p>
					<p>
						Synthpop as a genre is a sound and a mood. Synthpop makes you feel good, even when the lyrics it envelopes are sad. Synthpop is a simulation, not the real thing. Synthpop feels a few steps removed from reality and from pain. It allows some simulation of the processing of unresolvable trauma without confronting it. The 80’s were terrible, and the music was happy-sounding.
					</p>
					<p>
						Films, much like synthpop, remove pain from pain. Very few Hollywood movies are painful, even tragic ones. Good things tend to happen to the good guys and bad things to the bad guys. If the good guys suffer by the conclusion of a film, there is, at least, some musical flourish that prompts emotional release. Cinema assures you that you indeed watched a story with a point and so pain is lessened by constituting a functional part of a story, as opposed to a meaningless component of everyday life. Drive is a violent film without pain. Sometimes pain is simply offscreen. Other times, when brutality is on screen, only the less sympathetic characters suffer, and you are assured you are not supposed to feel pain by the music accompanying the violence. On a story-level, Hollywood escapism is incapable of mirroring lived reality. On a structural level, Hollywood escapism restricts the imagination of working-class people. Perhaps, then, what can be celebrated about film is the personal.
					</p>
					<p>
						I first watched Drive in a theater with a college roommate I like but no longer speak to. At least, I think I did. How far back did the seats lean? Was the theater full? Does anyone who was there that day recollect the things that I cannot about two hours several years ago? I do not remember much. But I remember the movie because I have seen it several times since then. I have experienced Drive for a total of 9 hours or so, and can experience it again at will. Each time I watch it, time passes and I experience an entire story. Pivotal months in a guy’s life condensed into two hours. And time keeps passing. Things happened between the first time I saw the film and the last time I saw it in order to write this essay. I lost my virginity in a bathhouse and, thus underprepared by that disastrous introduction to sex, subsequently experienced a series of parodies of romantic misadventures. I was fired from several jobs and did my utmost to get fired from the ones I ultimately quit. Other things happened. I’ve worked. I’ve seen movies.

						Marxist theorist Theodore Adorno was skeptical about the role of the culture industry in the lives of workers. Adorno once wrote: 
					</p>
					<p class="italicize">
						It may also be supposed that the consciousness of the consumers themselves is split between the prescribed fun which is supplied to them by the culture industry and a not particularly well-hidden doubt about its blessings. The phrase, the world wants to be deceived, has become truer than had ever been intended. People are not only, as the saying goes, falling for the swindle; if it guarantees them even the most fleeting gratification they desire a deception which is nonetheless transparent to them. …Without admitting it they sense that their lives would be completely intolerable as soon as they no longer clung to satisfactions which are none at all. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This is Adorno at his most sympathetic to working class people who filled their idle hours with cultural products provisioned by capitalists interested in sedating the masses with pretty stories about pretty people. It mirrors Marx’s famous declaration that “religion is the opium of the masses.” There is “truth” to Adorno’s and Marx’s pronouncements on the sedatives of the masses, be it religion or the culture industry. Both theorists also reduce the complexity and variety of religion and film in service of a theory. As theorists, both men engaged in abstract thinking. The words of Marxist theorists are seductive and convincing. Their abstractions from the lives of ordinary people seem to arrive at some truth that exists outside, while directing the experiences, of ordinary people. But stories are at least as seductive as theories. Stories are less abstract. Stories do not eliminate the details of a human life. The details keep us captivated. The assumption that a story has a point, if not a theory, keeps our attention. Movies are powerful storytellers.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you watch a movie enough times, it breaks into its parts. This scene and then the next. You see that it is assembled. It is no longer magic. Even if you accompany a movie with some other drug like weed or alcohol, a movie seen enough times breaks into its components. And so does life, because life is not a story. It is a series of days, most of which are forgotten. Days are an assemblage of moments. Most forgotten. Art can freeze a moment and make you think and feel something. Art is less easily forgotten.
					</p>
					<p>
						I cannot definitively say why one movie appeals to me more than another. Drive is a great movie amongst many great movies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Like all great art, it melds the familiar with the unfamiliar at just the right proportions. Like most Hollywood films, it is simple. Like most Hollywood movies, it tells you that maybe life would be simple if you were as young and beautiful and white as Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. Maybe life would be a simple story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, with the pointless bits edited out by memory. I suspect that life is not so simple, not even for Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. And certainly not for you and I.
